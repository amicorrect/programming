1.Write the code to calculate the average book rating for each publisher. Then, tabulate the result for
the top 20 publishers (kable/kableextra would be desired). Using a bar chart, visualise the average
rating for the top 10 publishers with the most ratings. You can choose to use either RatingPGA or
RatingPGB, or both. Explain your findings.

2. Analyse the distribution of book ratings by user age groups for example, ”0-18”, ”19-30”, ”31-45”, ”46-
60”, ”61+”. Visualise the distribution using a boxplot, with ‘Age‘ on the x-axis and ‘Book-Rating‘ on
the y-axis. You can choose to use either RatingPGA or RatingPGB or both. Explain your findings.
For this question, do NOT use tidyverse and only use the base R function.

3. Find out how the average book rating varies by location (country level) and tabulate them. Visualise
the top 5 countries with the highest average ratings using a bar chart for the 2 datasets. Discuss the
result. Is there any difference between the 2 datasets? (RatingPGA and RatingPGB)

4. Explore how book ratings vary by user age for books published after 2000. Use the data available to
investigate the relationship between user age and ratings, and present your findings in a bar chart
showing the average ratings for different age groups. Compare the results of the two datasets.
